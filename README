Installation
============

For now, it's a single module. Just copy it somewhere and import it as you
would import any other Python module.

Requirements:

couchdb - does all the real work. easy_install python-couchdb or download it
from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/CouchDB.

ProxyTypes - used to simplify wrapping documents to spot changes.
"easy_install ProxyTypes" or download it from
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ProxyTypes.


Usage
=====

The basic design is that an editing session behaves like a python-couchdb
Database instance as far as possible but performs all changes in a single bulk
update. The API should, therefore, by familiar already (which is my way of
saying this thing doesn't need documenting much ;-)).

There are two main differences:

1. Changes to existing documents are automagically tracked. No need to
   explicitly put them to the database.
2. You must call flush() to push the changes to the CouchDB.

{{{
import couchdb
import session

# Create a reference to a CouchDB database.
db = couchdb.Server()[db_name]
# Create an editing session
S = session.Session(db)
# Create an empty document
doc_id = S.create({})
# Make a change to an existing document
S['existing_id']['foo'] = 'bar'
# Delete an existing document
del S['another_existing_id']
# Flush all the changes to the CouchDB backend
S.flush()
}}}


Limitations
===========

* No support for attachments (yet).
* Not tested with (and may not even support) python-couchdb's schema. In other
  words, documents as dicts only.
* View counts may be affected by deleted documents.
* Views results may be out of sync until flushed.
* Attachments cannot (efficiently, at least) be include in the bulk update.


TODO
====

* Come up with a good name.
* Create package.
* Add some real-world tests.
* Support attachments.


IDEAS
=====

Hooks
-----

Notification hook for when documents are added, changed, or deleted. Hook
functions should be passed a reference to the editing session so they can
bundle changes in the same bulk update.


Attachments
-----------

Attachment should be cached to the file system somewhere and uploaded after the
bulk update. Unfortunately, there's no way to efficiently include attachment
changes in the bulk update so they'll have to happen out-of-band.


Document diffs
--------------

The change tracking has potential to be enhanced to build document diffs
containing actual data operations as opposed to a diff built by comparing
before and after versions.

Might be interesting for hooks and would be awesome if/when CouchDB supports
partial document updates.
